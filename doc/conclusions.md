# Handling Errors workshop

## Conclusions
- THERE IS NO MAGIC RULE.
- Avoiding exceptions is a good practice.
- IMHO, `Option` is not for handling errors, but for handling optional values.
- For handling errors, I always think about both `Try` and `Either`.
- Homogeneous APIs.
- Readable and maintainable code.
- Leverage everything the language offers, also third-party libraries.
- Why not.... Be more **functional**!!!
